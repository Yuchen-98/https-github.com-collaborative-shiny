# collaborative-shiny
Examples of shiny apps for more than one player

Functionality is based entirely on **shiny.collections** which is unfortunately deprecated. This library source code can be found on [Appsilon Data Science's](http://appsilon.com) Github: <br> <https://github.com/Appsilon/shiny.collections>

It is possible to install this library through [devtools](https://github.com/hadley/devtools).

	devtools::install_github("Appsilon/shiny.collections")


In addition, you need to have a [RethinkDB](https://rethinkdb.com/docs/install/) server running to use the apps. Installation packages can be found at the link. See also [this quickstart guide](https://rethinkdb.com/docs/quickstart/)
